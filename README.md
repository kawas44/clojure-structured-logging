# Structured Logging

The practice of logging application's information as structured data, easily
read, searched and analyzed by other applications or interested individuals.

Usually data are encoded and transferred as JSON data, a format easily
ingested by applications and databases. Contrary to string logs which
"flatten" all data in a plain string, JSON can use various data types and let
third party tools apply rich analysis on logged data.
